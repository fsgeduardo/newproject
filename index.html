        <p>The spread of the new coronavirus has created a lot of confusion, misinformation, and panic. The situation changes daily and our understanding of the disease is rapidly evolving.
        </p>

        <p>Here are some things we now know about the COVID-19 coronavirus:</p>

        <p>On average, about 5 new countries each day are reporting COVID-19 cases for the first time. The hardest hit countries so far are China, Italy, Iran and South Korea.</p>

        <p>Worldwide cases have exceeded 100,000 and deaths worldwide are now over 3000. This suggests a mortality rate of about 3%, but that estimate is likely too high and should come down as more mild cases are identified. Sicker patients will seek care, while patients with mild symptoms may go undetected, leading to inflated mortality rates.</p>

        <p>Even a 1% mortality rate may seem relatively safe but would place an enormous burden on hospitals, morgues and other medical services, and would be devastating to the economy. For example, in a city with a population of one million, assuming only 5% get the disease, that means 50,000 would be sick. Most (about 80%) would be mild cases, but 20% may require hospitalization. That’s 10,000 people in the hospital, and 500 deaths, possibly over a short period of time, like a few weeks. However, these calculations assume the disease spreads unchecked, which will not happen.</p>

        <p>So far the disease appears to be most dangerous to older patients and those with chronic illnesses. Severe symptoms in children appear to be uncommon. A study in China, where the most cases are, showed that women and children were less likely to die from the virus than men. More about that here https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51774777</p>

        <p>Public health efforts will focus on identifying cases, learning how it spreads, stopping the spread, and developing vaccines and treatments. Tests are available now, vaccines may be months away, and antivirals are being tested to see if they can help alleviate symptoms.</p>

        <p>In the United States, there are still 2 states that have not yet started testing patients for coronavirus- Maine, and West Virginia. Some other states have only started testing in the last few days. This will likely lead to a spike in reported cases where the virus has already been spreading for days or weeks.</p>

        <p>The best thing to do at this point is wash your hands frequently, try not to touch your face, stay at home if you are ill, seek medical care if you have flu-like symptoms (cough, fever), and stay informed.</p>

        <p>It started with a touch, and in the blink of an eye the coronavirus went global. Medical scientists will be sorting out exactly what happened for years to come, but we know for sure that travelers contracted a new, local virus and spread it around the world. We’re now paying the high price for our mobility, and travel will never be the same again.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire, and every organization involved in travel is now focused on one thing: How do we get through this? But looming in the distance is their next challenge: What can be done to minimize the damage when this happens in the future?</p>

        <p>We don’t have a crystal ball, but our social-distancing time has given us an opportunity to consider some of the issues facing travelers going forward. These four predictions may or may not come to pass. But the world of travel is about to undergo a seismic shift, and a bit of forethought will help us all be better prepared.</p>

        <p><strong>1. Air travel will get dicey.</strong></p>

        <p>The phrase “too big to fail” entered the lexicon during the financial meltdown of 2008, and as the crisis unfolded, the business world learned that there’s no such thing. Lengthy, widespread travel bans will test the financial strength of the entire travel industry, but the predominant businesses in the crosshairs will be airline companies.</p>

        <p><strong><em>“For airlines this is already bigger than the SARS epidemic, the aftermath of 9/11, or the 2008 financial crisis.” —Alex Cruz, CEO and chairman of British Airways</em></strong></p>

        <p>Undoubtedly, some of the smaller, less financially flush companies will fail. What this means for the flying public will be less competition between the surviving companies, and a corporate desire for a quick return to profitability – which will almost certainly lead to higher prices and fewer choices when you fly.</p>

        <h2 id="third-post">Hello from Bergen</h2>

        <p>Another week in lockdown mode has passed here in Bergen. This is the new normal. No big changes over the last week. The positive is that new numbers of people affected by corona have stabilized here in Norway. We still get new cases, but it’s not longer by an exponential growth by rather a straight curve.</p>

        <p>Like last week, I have been able to maintain work. However, this might be my last full week of work as I would like it to be. I have only gotten one new assignment during this time. Of course, it worries me, but I know I will get through the crises. Actually, I look forward to start those projects I otherwise never have time to work on, as I mentioned last week.</p>

        <p>This week I have mostly been working on a big story about life behind the scene at a theatre here in Bergen. All the photos were taken before the lockdown, as most of the interviews. Only days later, the theatre had to close down. It’s been strange to write about it. When I visited the theatre, it was full of life, and actors and stage workers, and other employees were given their best. Now it’s all dead and quite. All employees temporarily laid off. The contrast between now and then is particularly evident when I edit and process the photos.</p>

        <p>Winter has suddenly decided to show up in Bergen again. It’s the kind of winter we have over here. Suddenly lots of snow and as suddenly it’s all melted again, only moments later to start snowing again. And in between there is a feeling or spring in the air. I have enjoyed the snow and try to spend time out when I can—if nothing else, by running and exercising. Hopefully, it will snow again tomorrow, the first day of the weekend. If so, I will get my butt out and have fun in the snow. Maybe working on one of my photo projects, for which I have long wanted to get some winter photos.</p>

        <p>The theatre story was sent to the editor today. Now that I slowly will free up time for my own projects, one of the plans are to develop new online photo workshops. I already have a couple of ideas. But maybe you want to help me? Tell me what kind of photo workshops would be valuable to you. You can do so in a comment below, or if you wish to have me send my eBook 10 Great Tips for better photography, send me an email (to ottovon@online.no). You will receive the book for free.</p>

        <p>In these dire times, posts from fellow bloggers from around the world, provides hope and inspiration. Blogger Nicole with her blog Thirdeyemom, has started to collect and link to bloggers who share what they are going through during the pandemic. The unifying title is “Hello from…”. I think it’s an excellent idea, and this post here is my tribute. Maybe you want to be part of it? Go to Hello from Minnesota and post the link on Nicole’s blog.</p>
